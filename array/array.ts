/**
 * An array represents contiguous space in memory.
 *
 * Compared to Linked Lists, Arrays are better at reading operations: better
 * sequential access and random access. But, they are not so memory efficient,
 * Arrays require more memory than what they use.
 *
 * | Operation | Complexity |
 * | --------- | ---------- |
 * | Shift | O(n)       |
 * | Unshift | O(n)       |
 * | Push | O(1)       |
 * | Pop | O(1)       |
 * | Access    | O(1)       |
